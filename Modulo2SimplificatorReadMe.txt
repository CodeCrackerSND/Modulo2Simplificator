This is a modulo 2 equations simplificator,
First Simplificate button will simplificate as system of equations by adding equations,
while second button Product will try to write as product each equation separated.
When the project was developed variables was entered in format letter + number like x1, x2

In modulo 2 operations substraction ("-") is same as addition ("+") operator
Multiplication ("*") is not currently supported.

Example of usage:
x2(x1+x3+1)+x1+x3
should produce by hitting second button Product:
(x2+1)*(x1+1+x3)+1
